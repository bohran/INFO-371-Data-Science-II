    "# Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "From performing the KNN and TF-IDF algorithms on the different pieces of text and the rotten tomato reviews, we can conclude that the text pieces were better to perform the algorithms on, specifically TF-IDF. The algorithms may have performed more poorly on the Rotten Tomatoes data versus the texts because some keywords in the quote could've been misinterpreted. To gauge more accurately whether a not a movie review would be \"fresh\", we would have to do sentiment analysis to distinguish between positive and negative feelings within text. Due to this, it is harder for the algorithm to predict what would be considered \"fresh\" or \"rotten\" based on what the review entails. Overall, KNN gave on average about 20% less accuracy scores than TF-IDF. "
